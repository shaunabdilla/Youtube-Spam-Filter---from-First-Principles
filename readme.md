This was assessed content as part of my MSc in AI from the University of Malta.
The task was to take the dataset at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/YouTube+Spam+Collection and

compare 2 machine learning techniques for the modelling and prediction of data in the chosen dataset.
I was expected to implement these two ML techniques from first principles in Python, and then only expected
to make use of implemented third party libraries for comparative reasons, whilst also making use of the following:

¦ re-scaling and normalization
¦ cross-validation
¦ Principal Component Analysis
¦ feature selection
¦ evaluation method

The techniques selected were Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classification. The former outperformed the latter in all areas except Precision.
